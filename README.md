# TKA-PC-Port
A Windows port of Techno Kitten Adventure, originally developed by 21st Street Games and released on Xbox 360, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. As of 2022, all versions have been taken down from their respective stores.

This is a project to bring TKA to PC using the Xbox 360 version and the Microsoft XNA framework as a base.


**Current status:** The game will launch as a Visual Studio project but with minor graphical issues. However, the core gameplay is functional. Seizure warning for Popaganda Pack.

Requires the MonoGame extension for Visual Studio.

In final release, it will require .NET 6.0.
