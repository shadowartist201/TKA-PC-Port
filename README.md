## TKA PC Port
A Windows port of Techno Kitten Adventure, originally developed by 21st Street Games and released on Xbox 360, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. As of 2023, all versions have been taken down from their respective stores.

This is a project to bring TKA to PC (and hopefully other platforms) using the Xbox 360 version and Monogame as a base.

## Current status 
Popaganda Pack is done. Nyan Pack has minor bugs. Supports gamepad and keyboard input. Also supports multiple resolutions and fullscreen.

Controls as of current commit:
- S (Start)
- Spacebar (A)
- B (B)
- F1 (Unlock all cats, for debug purposes)
